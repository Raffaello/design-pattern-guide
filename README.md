[Variaous Design pattern can be categorized into three groups:](https://github.com/bhochhi/design-pattern-guide/wiki/Variaous-Design-patterns)

   
###[What is data driven development?](https://github.com/bhochhi/design-pattern-guide/wiki/What-is-data-driven-programming%3F) 

Development means design and program.

###[Domain driven design vs Data Driven Design]()

Most often I have use certain techniques and approaches without giving much thoughts to it, like what kind 

__ The problems we wanted to solve needed different way of thinkings, that means a paradigm shift is needed to solve various problems. contexts, complexity are different for different problems. If you trying to solve all such problem using the same techniques, practices and patterns, you may end up with the solution but the path and process would be painful and complex, inconvinent and results to anti-pattern to reach the goal. All I am saying is its not good idea to try to solve all problems with the same set of mind, you need to develop different way of thinkings, which gives birth to various paradigms. Now, the problem is how to know what paradigm is better shoots to what kind of problems? __

__How to know which paradigm is choose? Depends upon what is required/problem and also on the what type of development platform we choose, as some may not suppose certain methodology and approaches. This means Design and programing is very co-related. You can not design the system and expect to be implemented readily on any platform you choose. you need to tune the design with certain paradigm that is supported by your programming platform. For instance, use OOD to implement using OOP. Use Data-driven Design to use Data-Driven Programming. 

Recently I was trying to reorganize my thoughts on various design approaches I have been practicing. One of them is Data-Driven Design. Most often, there were certain techniques that I apply
