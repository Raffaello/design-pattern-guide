Clean code checklist

* Code is clean if it can be understood easily by everyone on the team. With Understandability comes readability, changeability, extensibility and maintability. All the things needed to keep a project going over a long time without accumulating up a large amount of technical debt.
* Writing clean code from the start in a project is an investment in keeping the Cost of Change(CoC) as constant as possible throughout the lifecycle of a software product. Building the house analogy applies here. If you spend little more initaially during the fundation, your maintenance cost will be less compare to house that were built quick and dirty.

Simplification merely hides the complex logic behind framework code or reusable components.In essence, it shifts complexity from one part of the system that needs explicit management by application developers to another part invisible to most developers. 

*  what drives us to use certain approaches, tools and techniques during building the software products?

Test Driven Development, Behavior-driven Design ...
